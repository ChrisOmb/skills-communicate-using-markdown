# I am learning Markdown language on 29 Dec 2024

## This is an H2 since it has 2#

I have learned that the `#` are for headers and go up to 6, but a space must be between the last `#` and the word.

## Adding an Image

![Image I have addedâ€”it's of a Yaktocat](https://i.ibb.co/Csfm16s/image.jpg)

I have noted that '!' must begin before the alt text '[]'

## Input block of code

```  python
myName = input("what is your name?")
```

The piece of code renders differently depending on the type of language 

``` javascript
let myName = "Chris"
```

Noted -- After the ``` add the name of language   e.g 
<''' 'language'>

## Making a List
This is simply as the name dictates it's a list but more of a to-do list
- [ ] Rember what i have learnt
- [ ] Apply what i have learnt
- [x] Keep up the spirit

This works in a way that  - [ ] this implies a list and adding 'x' between it becames checked
